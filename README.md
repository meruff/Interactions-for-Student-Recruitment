# Interactions-for-Student-Recruitment
This repo was set up for University of Miami's *Interactions for Student Recruitment*.

## Synopsis
*Interactions for Student Recruitment* provides higher education institutions the tools they need to manage student recruitment in Salesforce. As an unmanaged package/open-source code, it builds on the Higher Education Data Architecture (HEDA) data model and uses Affiliations, Administrative Accounts, and other HEDA features. *Interactions for Student Recruitment* uses Salesforce-standard Duplicate Management with new functionality called Interactions, which save time and reduce duplicate records by streamlining the data entry process. It provides a highly customizable structure to standard functionality such as Opportunities and Campaigns to meet the many different needs of a higher education institution. This project was funded by a Salesforce.org technology innovation grant and includes technical documentation, user guides, learning guides, and other documents to help universities get started with recruiting in Salesforce. 

We welcome contributions and feedback. Read below for more information about how to get involved!

## Motivation
Our project team has implemented out-of-the-box, managed package, and hybrid approaches for automating student recruitment. We would like to share our lessons learned and best practices with new and existing Salesforce schools. Our goal is to extend HEDA to provide structure and functionality around student recruitment. We will complete this goal by simplifying the entry of one-on-one interactions in Salesforce while also automating stages of the recruitment process, simplifying pipeline management, and bringing together marketing and recruiting efforts to focus on the most promising prospects. It is our sincere hope that other universities, as well as consultants, look to build upon as well as improve *Interactions for Student Recruitment*. To get involved, please see the Maintenance and Collaboration section below.

## Installation
You can install *Interactions for Student Recruitment* as-is into any Developer Edition, Sandbox, Enterprise, or higher edition org in which HEDA has been installed. The HEDA installer for existing orgs can be found <a href="https://mrbelvedere.salesforcefoundation.org/mpinstaller/hed" target="_blank">here</a>. If you are unfamiliar with HEDA, we recommend learning more about it and its installation and trial org options by reviewing the documentation available <a href="https://powerofus.force.com/articles/Resource/Install-and-Configure-the-Higher-Education-Data-Architecture-HEDA" target="_blank">here</a>. Once HEDA has been installed into an org, you can easily install *Interactions for Student Recruitment* in a sandbox or production/developer org using these unmanaged package links and the <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Interactions-for-Student-Recruitment/blob/master/Docs/Installation%20and%20Configuration%20Guide%20-%20Interactions%20for%20Student%20Recruitment.pdf" target="_blank">Installation and Configuration Guide</a>:
